IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM THEN I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUTSOME DRAWBACKS

1) I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THIS CODE INFORMATIVE BUT IT WILL NOT BE EASY

2)IF YOU ARE TRYING TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM THEN DO NOT PANIC IF YOU GET THE WRONG ANSWER

	TRY REARRANGING THE ORDER OF THE FD(FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY) YOU ARE ENTERING.

	THERE IS A STRICT INPUT FORMAT FOR THIS BUT IT WORKS.

	AND THERE WILL BE A LIMIT TO HOW MANY FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY YOU CAN INPUT SO BE CAREFUL.

3)THE INPUT FORMAT IS LIKE THIS:

(ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM WILL STILL WORK BUT IF THE INPUT IS COMPLEX OR HAS MORE NUMBER OF FD THEN IT IS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW THIS FORMAT)
	
	ENTER THE FD IN ORDER WHERE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FD HAS MINIMUM VARIABLES FOR EXAMPLE:

	A->B
	B->C
	AB->C
	ABC->D
	^^
	(THIS IS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FD)

	DO NOT ENTER IT LIKE : 

	ABC->D
	B->C
	AB->C
	A->B
